# CompPySS
Python implementation of the CompPASS algorithm

This is a Python implementation of the Comparative Proteomic Analysis Software Suite (CompPASS) for scoring affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) experiments. The algorithm was developed by Dr. Mathew Sowa for defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape (Sowa, Mathew E., et al 2009) and the Python code is based on the R packages [cRomppass](https://github.com/dnusinow/cRomppass) (David Nusinow) and [SMAD](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SMAD.html) (Qingzhou Zhang).
